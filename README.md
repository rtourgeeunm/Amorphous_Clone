Welcome to UNM Taos's GODOT Course.

In this course, we will learn how to create a simple game based on a somewhat popular flash game called Amorphous and Amorphous+.

Amorphous
  https://web-gaming.fandom.com/wiki/Amorphous  
  
  Released on Kongregate and developed by Innoculous Games, Amorphous is a top-down hack and slash game in which you survive on various maps against dangerous slimes
  called glooples.
  Throughout the game, you unlock various types of gloople enemies and rewards which you can check and activate in between runs.
  
Gameplay
  Once a game starts, you run around the screen, swinging a sword at glooples while dodging thier attacks.
  You use your mouse to direct your character and click to swing your sword.
  Glooples will get more powerful as the game goes on and it runs until you've destroyed a predetermined amount of glooples or until they destroy your character.
  Destroying more dangerous glooples earns you more points.
  
Glooples
  Glooples come in a variety of types with varying abilities, all dangerous to the your character.
  Some examples include,
    Green Gloople
      Will stun you if they touch you, making it easier for others to attack you.
    Amorphous Gloople
      Will absorb other glooples to get bigger and faster. When attacked it will split into multiple, which can in turn, absorb more glooples.
    Meltie
      When destroyed, will leave an acid splatter on the floor, which can hurt the player and other glooples.
    Void Eater
      Will periodically fire a laser across the map that will draw the player and other glooples in and instantly destroy whatever it touches.
  There are more.
  
Menu
  Includes options for starting a new run, alternate game modes such as practice and bounty mode, game options, checking rewards and achievements, and exiting the game
